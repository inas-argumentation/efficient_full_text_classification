Yet, the microbial communities associated with invasive plants are generally poorly understood. Here we report on the first comprehensive investigation of the bacterial and fungal communities inhabiting the rhizosphere and the surrounding bulk soil of a widespread invasive tree, Acacia dealbata. Amplicon sequencing data indicated that rhizospheric microbial communities differed significantly in structure and composition from those of the bulk soil. Two bacterial (Alphaproteobacteria and Gammaproteobacteria) and two fungal (Pezizomycetes and Agaricomycetes) classes were enriched in the rhizosphere compared with bulk soils. Changes in nutritional status, possibly induced by A. dealbata, primarily shaped rhizosphere soil communities. Despite a high degree of geographic variability in the diversity and composition of microbial communities, invasive A. dealbata populations shared a core of bacterial and fungal taxa, some of which are known to be involved in N and P cycling, while others are regarded as plant pathogens. Shotgun metagenomic analysis also showed that several functional genes related to plant growth promotion were overrepresented in the rhizospheres of A. dealbata. Overall, results suggest that rhizosphere microbes may contribute to the widespread success of this invader in novel environments. Introduction Invasive trees are a global concern because they pose a direct threat to natural ecosystems and cause important economic losses, although they also provide goods and services that sustain human populations1. Australian acacias are among the most invasive trees worldwide2. In their invasive ranges, acacias have had numerous and severe environmental impacts3, 4. For example, Acacia dealbata (silver wattle) is an aggressive invader in southern Europe, the Americas and southern Africa2. In South Africa, this species reduces water availability5, and alters faunal6 and microbial7 community diversity and composition. Acacia dealbata also reduces the abundance and cover of native plant species under its understory8 and modifies soil basal respiration and soil enzymatic activities9, two important proxies for ecosystem functioning. Plant species traits (e.g., high seed outputs, adaptability), abiotic factors (e.g., similar climate and soil chemistry in native and invaded ranges), native range biogeography, and deliberate and accidental human intervention10, have been commonly used to explain why many acacia species have become invasive in new environments11. It is also likely that rhizosphere microbes (native or introduced), such as bacteria and fungi, play an important role in the establishment and invasion success of acacias12. Microbial communities influence many important ecosystem processes, including plant nutrient acquisition and nitrogen and carbon cycling13, which regulate plant diversity and productivity. For example, acacias develop symbiotic associations with rhizobia that convert atmospheric nitrogen into plant available ammonium14. Recent work has shown that invasive acacias in South Africa\u2019s Cape Floristic Region (CFR) associate with a diverse assemblage of Bradyrhizobium strains that are not commonly associated with native legumes15. Acacias also interact with arbuscular mycorrhizal (AMF) and/or ectomycorrhizal (EMF) fungi16 which modify the root system and enhance mobilization and the uptake of several essential elements, especially phosphorus17. On the other hand, microbial parasites and pathogens, through their effects on plant health and productivity, may impact negatively on plant invasiveness18. Apart from the interactions of acacias with rhizobia and mycorrhiza, there is currently little knowledge about the identity of the overall soil microbial communities associated with acacia species. For instance, for A. dealbata only limited data are available from studies employing low resolution methods and/or low sample sizes19, 20 (but see ref. 7). In addition, most of these studies were carried out in soils in the proximity of plants, but not in the narrow zone of soil that surrounds and is most influenced by plant roots (i.e., the rhizosphere). As rhizosphere microbes can directly and/or indirectly affect the composition and biomass of plant communities21, increasing our knowledge on the root microbiome is important to better understand the factors contributing to plant invasiveness. Here, we use Illumina MiSeq data (targeting 16S rRNA genes and ITS regions) and shotgun metagenomics to investigate microbial (bacterial and fungal) communities and functional processes associated with the roots of this species in various invasive populations of A. dealbata across South African grasslands, and compare them with those from the bulk soil. More specifically, we evaluate (i) how abiotic (i.e., soil chemistry) factors may shape the diversity and structure of these communities, (ii) identify prominent taxa that may contribute to the success of this invader and (iii) investigate whether rhizosphere and bulk soil microbial communities differ in their metabolic capacity. Results and Discussion Analysing the microbial communities associated with the rhizospheres of A. dealbata, we obtained 2,444,152 and 694,434 total high-quality reads, which resulted in 29,678 and 14,471 OTUs (97% cut-off) for bacteria and fungi, respectively. The majority of all prokaryotic OTUs in the rhizosphere were also present in the bulk soils (Supplementary Fig. S2a), whereas a larger proportion of the eukaryotic OTUs were unique to the sample type (Supplementary Fig. S2b). For both bacterial and fungal communities the OTUs shared between rhizosphere and bulk soil samples accounted for the majority of the reads (97.2% and 93% respectively; Supplementary Fig. S2a,b). The percentage of OTUs shared between all eight sampling sites was considerably smaller for fungal data sets than for the bacterial data sets (1.6% and 12%, respectively). This is in agreement with the view that fungal communities generally show more geographic structure than bacterial communities22. OTU accumulation curves indicated reasonable sequence saturation at a regional level, especially for bacteria (Supplementary Fig. S3). The levels of microbial diversity (richness, Shannon, inverse Simpson, Pielou\u2019s evenness) tended to be higher in the bulk soil than in the rhizosphere samples, although they did not differ significantly (Supplementary Fig. S4). This is in contrast to previous studies19, which showed A. dealbata-invaded zones containing higher bacterial richness and lower fungal richness compared to uninvaded zones. However, it is now accepted that the community fingerprinting method used in that study (i.e., DGGE) is not well suited to accurately estimate microbial richness23. A total of 30 distinct bacterial phyla were detected across all samples. The most abundant sequences were affiliated with the phylum Proteobacteria (27% of total relative abundance), followed by Actinobacteria (23%), Acidobacteria (18%), Planctomycetes (8%) and Bacteroidetes (5%) (Fig. 1). These phyla have been shown to be widely represented in bulk and rhizosphere soil samples (e.g., see review by ref. 21), including those from other invasive species such as Japanese barberry24. At the class level, Actinobacteria (22%), Acidobacteria (17%), Alphaproteobacteria (17%), Planctomycetia (8%) and Betaproteobacteria (6%) were represented by the majority of sequences. Rhizosphere soil samples were enriched for Alphaproteobacteria (Kruskal-Wallis \u03c72 = 4.4; P < 0.05) and Gammaproteobacteria (Kruskal-Wallis \u03c72 = 7.4; P < 0.01), and depauperate in Spartobacteria (Verrucomicrobia; Kruskal-Wallis \u03c72 = 9.1; P < 0.01), compared with the bulk soil. Members of the Alphaproteobacteria and Gammaproteobacteria are usually defined as copiotrophic25; that is, they compete successfully when organic resources are abundant. The high abundance of these OTUs in the rhizosphere of A. dealbata plants could reflect their ability to proliferate in the presence of plant-derived polysaccharides. Spartobacteria are highly abundant in grassland soils26, probably because they associate with nematodes, which are typically abundant in grasslands27. Whether the decrease in Spartobacteria in this study results directly from the effects of wattles or indirectly through trophic cascades needs to be further investigated.

The dominance of these Australian symbiotic loci in the studied rhizobial community might be explained by the invasion of exotic bacteria or by lateral transfer of these symbiotic loci from introduced strains to the local bacteria. Australian bradyrhizobia might indeed nodulate the two native legumes as can be deduced from the strains that were common to the three host plants, but lateral transfer cannot be ruled out in this study. In any case, the final result is the invasion by exotic genes that disrupt the interaction between local plants and bradyrhizobia. Apart from the displacement of native vegetation and the increased inputs of organic matter and nitrogen in the invaded sand dune system (Marchante et al., 2008b), the above\u2010ground dominance of A. longifolia is mirrored below ground by the dominance of exotic bradyrhizobia and symbiotic loci that not only promote the growth of the exotic legume but also disrupt the native legume\u2013rhizobia symbiosis. The limited number of nodA genes from this study in the European clade proves the over\u2010representation of Australian symbiotic genes in the bradyrhizobial community of the invaded area. The prevalence of Australian nifD and nodA genes among the bradyrhizobia obtained from the native legumes suggests that the exotic bacteria not only promote the growth of the invader (Rodr\u00edguez\u2010Echeverr\u00eda et al., 2009) but can also strongly modify the native legume\u2013rhizobia symbiosis.

The interactions between the Burmese myna and the Syrian woodpecker and between the Burmese myna and the common myna were especially aggressive and included much physical contact between the interacting birds. The Burmese myna replaced nesting Syrian woodpeckers twice before the latter completed their breeding cycle, and replaced the locally rare scops owl once. Burmese mynas showed strong competition with the native woodpeckers over cavities. Contrary to the common mynas, the smaller Burmese myna shares similar cavity preferences with the woodpeckers and can occupy woodpecker nest without any modification of cavity size and type. They also strongly prefer to nest in intact woodpeckers cavities. Indeed, we found that Burmese mynas and woodpeckers interacted aggressively around most of the active woodpecker cavities observed, and we recorded two aggressive nesting woodpecker replacements by the Burmese myna during the woodpeckers\u2019 breeding cycle. Thus, these species show contramensalism (\u00b1). The native Syrian woodpecker, which excavated majority of cavities used for breeding in the park, clearly facilitates the establishment of the Burmese myna. This suggests that the Burmese mynas may pose the largest threat to the native cavity engineers, since they are small enough (Feare and Craig 1999; Cramp and Perrins 1994) to enter the cavity and their nesting period overlaps with the woodpeckers\u2019 nesting season. Our results indicate that the control of the Burmese myna may be the most beneficial management action for the native cavity nesters in the Yarkon Park, as it may lead to competitive release of the woodpeckers from the alien invasive myna and may improve the breeding situation for the native great tits, the house sparrows and for the scops owls."}}, "Acridotheres fuscus": {"107": {"paper_id": 107, "title": "The introduced and native terrestrial vertebrates of Fiji", "full_reference": "Pernetta, J.

Crimson Rosella abundance increased throughout the survey period by an estimated 5.9 (60.3) birds per km2 each year. However, after Common Myna establishment, growth in abundance declined by an estimated 3.5 (60.3) birds per km2 each year. We found a significant negative relationship between Common Myna establishment and the abundance of seven of the eight small bird species we examined (Table 2). The abundance of the Superb Fairy-wren, Striated Pardalote, Willie Wagtail, Grey Fantail, Magpie Lark, Silvereye and Common Blackbird increased throughout the survey period (Table 2, Figure 3).

We then investigated the impact of common myna nest box occupation on crimson rosella and eastern rosella abundance. Tree density significantly influenced the abundance and cavity-nesting of all three species. Common myna abundance (birds per square kilometer) was greatest at low tree density sites (101.9 \u00b1 22.4) and declined at medium (45.4 \u00b1 10.1) and high (9.7 \u00b1 3.6) tree density sites. The opposite pattern was observed for the crimson rosella, with greater abundance (birds per square kilometer) at high tree density sites (83.9 \u00b1 9.3), declining over medium (61.6 \u00b1 6.4) and low (31.4 \u00b1 3.9) tree density sites. The eastern rosella was more abundant at medium tree density sites (48.6 \u00b1 8.0 birds per square kilometer). Despite the strong influence of tree density, we found a significant negative relationship between common myna nest box occupancy and the abundance of the crimson rosella (F 1,13 = 7.548, P = 0.017) and eastern rosella (F 1,13 = 9.672, P < 0.001) at some sites.

Our study provides the strongest evidence to date for the negative impact of the common myna on native bird abundance through cavity-nesting competition. However, due to the strong influence of habitat on species abundance and nesting, it is essential to investigate the impacts of introduced species in conjunction with habitat variation. We also suggest one component of introduced species management could include habitat restoration to reduce habitat suitability for introduced species.

The higher number of encounters and interactions between Indian Mynah and Tahiti Flycatcher around nests containing eggs and chicks strongly suggests the existence of nest predation by Indian Mynah, whereas the more uniform presence of Red-vented Bulbul, during and outside reproductive activity suggests the existence of an inter-specific competition for nest sites and territories, rather than direct nest predation."}, "116": {"paper_id": 116, "title": "The use of nest boxes in urban natural vegetation remnants by vertebrate fauna", "full_reference": "Harper, M.

We found evidence that the probability of a nest box being occupied by either species of possum was greater in remnants with abundant possum populations. Brushtail possums preferred thick-walled pine nest boxes over thin-walled plywood nest boxes, most likely owing to differences in their thermal insulation properties.

The presence of dogs and cats was not related to the total abundance of birds overall or small birds in gardens. While garden characteristics may influence the presence of small birds to some degree, the presence of noisy miners, a species that are thought to aggressively exclude other species from their territories, is likely to be an important influence on these species in suburban areas.

The myna excludes the smaller invasive vinous-breasted starling, a direct competitor of the primary nest excavator, the native Syrian woodpecker.

Analysis of nest site selection indicated that Common Mynas chose to nest in more highly modified habitats, and in artificial structures rather than in vegetation. These findings suggest that, in this study area, Common Mynas have little competitive impact on resource use by native bird species in the urban matrix.

Most birds nested in earthen burrows, but they also readily used artificial ones. The nesting chronology at the study area was similar among years and nearly identical to that recorded elsewhere in Hawaii. Shearwaters began to arrive in March, and spent considerable time rehabilitating burrows before laying eggs synchronously in June. Most eggs hatched between 1 and 12 August. Chicks fledged more than 100 days later during November. Approximately 80% of the eggs produced fledglings in 1978 and 1979, but success dropped in 1980 and 198 1, probably because of predation and human disturbance. Most of the loss of potential production at Kilauea Point involved egg mortality, since over 85% of the eggs that hatched in natural and artificial burrows produced fledglings, except in 1980 (Table 4). The major cause of egg mortality differed among years. In 1978, nearly all of it was due to predation by the Common Myna. During the 1981 breeding season, a barrierfence was built around the visitor-use area during mid- to late incubation, and the shearwaters were disturbed less, at least late in the season. Nevertheless, predation by Common Mynas was as severe in 198 1 as it had been in 1978> probably because it was impossible to repel these birds (Byrd and Moriarty 1980) at the proper time. Chick mortality resulted from several factors. A few chicks died of unknown causes within one week after hatching. However, the major cause of mortality among older chicks was the destruction of burrows, owing to either human intrusion in the colony (1980) or heavy rainfall (other years ofour study). Several chicks were buried by mud after burrows collapsed, but more commonly death resulted from predation by owls (Byrd and Telfer 1980), exposure to high temperatures, or starvation after chicks wandered away from burrow sites and adults failed to find them. Similar consequences of heavy rainfall have been reported at a shearwater colony on Manana Island, Hawaii (Whittow 1979). Dogs and cats were significant predators at Kilauea Point (Titcomb 1960) until control measures were instituted there in 1975.

When Sooty Terns are absent from the island, mynas regularly feed in the deserted nesting area, mainly on insects.While catching incubating ground-nesting adult Brown Noddies for ringing and other studies in 2013 and 2014, CL & MD discovered that while adults were being processed, mynas rapidly approached the unguarded nests and took the eggs. Eggs were sometimes taken less than one minute after the breeding adult was captured and the egg was left unguarded. Of the 31 nests on the ground that were monitored for the purpose of the ringing study, egg predation by mynas was observed in three cases. Four other eggs were lost the day after the noddies were processed, potentially also resulting from myna predation, although we cannot exclude the possibility that other potential predators, Common Moorhens Gallinula chloropus or land crabs, could have been involved. After CL & MD realised that such rapid and frequent myna predation was occurring, all eggs of birds caught for processing were temporarily covered with a cloth, which was flying back to their nests (usually within five minutes). This simple protection method was successful as none of the eggs in the remaining nests that we monitored was predated within the 24 hours after the birds were captured. At the approach of humans, nesting Lesser Noddies become agitated and highly vocal, and in 2011\u201314 CJF & CSL noticed that such agitation and calling was also stimulated by the arrival of a pair of mynas in a nesting tree (Fig. 2). Closer observation revealed that pairs of mynas climbed among the branches, sometimes leading a Lesser Noddy to leave its nest in an attempt to deter the myna, but the unattended egg was quickly taken. The members of the pair appeared to be working together, one creating a distraction that permitted the other to take the egg. Disturbance by humans, including unwitting tourists when taking photographs, could leave eggs open to predation when mynas are present."}, "133": {"paper_id": 133, "title": "The Ecology of the Common Myna in Urban Nature Reserves in the Australian Capital Territory", "full_reference": "Pell, A.S. and Tidemann, C.R.

Nonetheless, there is a growing attention to the potential conservation value of hybridization in fastening the adaptive evolutionary responses to rapidly changing selective pressures. Under these premises, we investigated the genetic affinity of the red-legged partridge (Alectoris rufa) population inhabiting Elba Island (Italy) in the context of the overall species phylogeography and particularly of the nominate subspecies it is traditionally ascribed to. Although notoriously hybrid with the congeneric A. chukar, this island population is of undisputedly value because of its long natural history and self-sustainability. As such, its adaptive conservation management calls for a comprehensive knowledge including the assessment of its geographic origin. For this purpose, 110 fecal samples were collected across Elba, genotyped at their joint Cytochrome-b and Control Region genes (2,249 characters), and compared with 149 conspecifics from all over the species distribution range. We confirmed a widespread A. chukar mitochondrial DNA introgression in Elba partridges, whereas their expected formal assignment to the nominate subspecies from Italy and France was rejected, since these turned out to be closely related to conspecifics from the Iberian Peninsula. This counterintuitive result found support in a large variety of literary sources and compelling evidences from personal testimonies revealing recent intense management with farm-reared birds of Spanish origin.

Indeed, the admixture with conspecifics from the Iberian Peninsula does not necessarily mean that the entirety of the native nuclear genome of Elba partridges has been wiped out.

First, we looked for evidences of hybridization in both game farms. Using actographic methods, we measured migratory tendency. Birds, hatched in summer, were submitted in autumn to an artificial increase of daylength (LD 14:10) for 60 days. In quails, the length of the cloacal vent which is a good indicator of sexual development, was monitored every 10 days. We noted the appearance of cloacal foam in males and egg-laying activity in females. In addition, mating calls produced by the males when sexually mature were recorded and analyzed using spectrographic methods. Seventeen males of 27 from the French game farm exhibited nocturnal restlessness. Most of the birds of the Italian game farm (40/44) developed sexually without showing any migratory activity. Since Japanese quail has lost its migratory impulse during the domestication process, the presence of migratory activity in quails of both game farms clearly demonstrated the introduction of wild European quail. Spectrographic analysis of male mating calls confirmed this assumption: some males in both game farms (21/27 in the French game farm, 5/22 in the Italian game farm) produced calls similar to those produced by control lines of hybrid quails (Japanese\u00d7European). In an additional experiment, we report the results of encounters between males of the French game farm and males of European quail. One bird of each strain were put together on day 1 and on day 3, we introduced in the pen a female European quail. In 11 cases out of 11, the male of the French game farm dominated the male European quail and monopolized the female.

Such practices are thought to be a severe threat for the native species as it could lead to introgression of domestic Japanese quail alleles into the wild common quail genome and potentially alter the migratory and reproductive behaviour in wild populations. In this study, we assessed the genetic purity of a captive population of common quail that was established from wild-caught founders caught on the Southern Italian coast in Sicily (Italy). We evaluated the proportion of ancestry to common and Japanese quail in this captive population via genetic screening using nuclear microsatellite markers and mitochondrial DNA analyses. We showed that the captive farm quail in our study had no sign of admixture with domestic Japanese quail and had similar genotype frequencies relative to wild common quail, confirming the success of the breeding programme for the native species.

We investigated habitat use and feeding ecology of the Mauritius fody during two early phases of its reintroduction onto a restored islet, and compared these parameters with the sympatric population of Madagascar fodies. The number of Mauritius fody territories increased from 4 to 20 in a seven month period following release, and overall mean territory area (c. 1 ha) was significantly larger than that of the more abundant Madagascar fody (c. 0.07 ha). The initial four territories were located in mature coastal forest, whilst those of the Madagascar fody were characterised by open canopy, smaller trees and grass-dominated ground cover. Mauritius fodies foraged mainly in dead leaves for insects, whilst the Madagascar fody fed primarily on the seeds of a native grass species. Mauritius fody territories later expanded to include a range of habitats. Differing ecological requirements indicate that divergence between these congeners may be sufficient for them to coexist and exploit contrasting resources on restored islets. We discuss the implications of these findings for both the long-term restoration of the Mauritius fody and other avian recovery programmes and highlight the critical importance of long-term post-release monitoring to assess the success of reintroduction to offshore islets as a long-term conservation strategy.

Superficially they are similar to Antarctic Prions, breeding in small burrows during the summer months (Bonadonna and Mardon, 2010 ). So why did prions persist while Blue Petrels perished? In part, it appears to be because Blue Petrels are present for more months in the year reoccupying burrows at the end of the breeding season, and in part because they are restricted at high latitudes to low elevations. While there were undoubtedly impacts from rats and cats, Wekas Galliralus australis, in particular, are implicated in the complete removal of formerly abundant small petrels from coastal slopes of Macquarie (Brothers and Skira, 1984). Wekas avoided cat predation by occupying dense tussock grasslands around the coast, rarely occurring on the exposed plateau where vegetation is low and sparse. They damaged breeding burrows and predated eggs and chicks (Falla, 1937). The low elevation Blue Petrels succumbed, whereas Antarctic Prions survived in higher elevation refugial habitat on the plateau away from Wekas. Species declines in the presence of Wekas and cats, and their survival or extinction were governed by body size, breeding phenology, and the width of their realized niche on the island.

The tendencies for 14 passerine birds to have positive or negative associations were examined, using 7861 sample points in seven native forests on the islands of Hawaii, Maui, and Kauai. All birds were at least partly insectivorous and were fairly common in forested areas, although some fed chiefly on nectar or fruit. Species-pairs were classified as primary or secondary potential competitors based on general dietary similarity. To evaluate the association between species and to account for the effect of individual species' habitat preferences, partial correlations were computed for each species-pair in a study area from the simple correlations between the species and 26 habitat variables plus two quadratic terms to represent nonlinearity. The partial correlations represented a short-term (\"instantaneous\") assessment of the strength of competitive interactions, and did not reflect the accumulation of competitive displacement through time. Of 170 partial correlations in the analysis, only 10 indicated significant negative association. The general pattern was of positive association (76 significantly positive partials), which probably resulted from flocking and from attraction of birds to areas of resource superabundance. Two species-pairs showed consistent patterns of negative partial correlations over several adjacent study areas, the Japanese White-eye/Iiwi in montane Hawaii, and the Japanese White-eye/Elepaio in windward Hawaii; both patterns could be reasonably attributed to direct competition. Species-pairs were grouped by the native or exotic status of the component species. Native/exotic pairs had a significantly greater proportion of negative partial correlations (37%) than either native/ native pairs (8%) or exotic/exotic pairs (0%). This pattern was consistent across the seven study areas and appeared to reflect the occurrence of interspecific competition along a broad and diffuse ecological \"front\" between a co-evolved native avifauna and recently introduced exotic species. The role of competition in the pattern was corroborated by the significantly higher proportion of negative partial correlations among species-pairs of primary potential competitors than among those of secondary potential competitors. Our results suggested that t47% of the primary potential competitors among native/exotic species-pairs may experience at least small depressions in local population density due to competition. Although the negative correlations were for the most part small (average negative r = 0.06), one species could eventually replace another as spatial displacement accumulated through time. The Japanese White-eye appeared to have a principal role in native/exotic interactions, with 62% of the partial correlations between it and native primary potential competitor species being negative. Noteworthy implications were that (1) it was important to account for the habitat responses of individual species when studying the role of interspecific competition in modifying small-scale geographic distribution; (2) competition was frequently sporadic in its geographic occurrence and in the species affected, thus supporting Wiens' (1977) theory of competition; and (3) as a consequence, the role of interspecific competition in modifying distribution may be difficult to detect statistically with small data sets."}, "306": {"paper_id": 306, "title": "Genetic introgression between an introduced babbler, the Chinese hwamei Leucodioptron c. canorum, and the endemic Taiwan hwamei L. taewanus: A multiple marker systems analysis", "full_reference": "Li, S.

Fifty- five Chinese hwameis from the Asian mainland and 69 Taiwan hwameis, including nine morphological hybrids, were sampled and analyzed.

Five unlinked interspecific SNPs were identified at nine anonymous nuclear loci with interspecific differentiation (total Fst00.77) that was much higher than that at seven highly polymorphic microsatellite loci combined (total Fst00.1). Bayesian cluster analysis based on five interspecific SNP loci and two highly differentiated microsatellite loci (Fst?0.08) suggested that twelve individuals sampled in Taiwan were likely F2 or backcross hybrids, among which eight were morphological intermediates. A total of 20.3% (14/69) individuals sampled in Taiwan were suggested to be hybrids, suggesting that fitness reduction in hybrids might be negligible. These results imply that without an effective management strategy, the entire Taiwan hwamei population could easily become an admixed with Chinese hwamei and loose its evolutionary integrity.

Seed rain of bird- dispersed seeds was extensive in both forests, totaling 724 seeds of 9 native species and 2 exotics with over 85% of the seeds coming from native plants.Without suitable native dispersers, most common understory plants in Hawaiian rainforests nowdepend on introduced birds for dispersal, and these introduced species may actually facilitate perpetuation, and perhaps in some cases restoration, of native forests. We emphasize, however, that restoration of native forests by seed dispersal from introduced birds, as seen in this study, depends on the existence of native forests to provide a source of seeds and protection from the effects of ungulates. Our results further suggest that aggressive con.trol of patches of non-native plants within otherwise native-dominated forests may be an important and effective conservation strategy"}}, "Gymnorhina tibicen": {"309": {"paper_id": 309, "title": "Using five-minute bird counts to study magpie (Gymnorhina tibicen) impacts on other birds in New Zealand", "full_reference": "Innes, J.G., Spurr, E.B., Arnold, G., Morgan, D.K.J., Waas, J.R., Watts, C.

Both species are known to move many kilometres to seasonal food sources, including across pasture in fragmented landscapes. Neither species forages commonly on pasture on the New Zealand mainland, and it is unclear why magpies attack such apparently harmless species. We suggest introduced mammals preying on nests in native forests are primarily likely to limit t\u016b\u012b and kerer\u016b numbers in the wider landscape (Innes et al. 2004, 2005), but magpies may block access to key, perhaps seasonal, resources for these birds at particular sites. Magpies are also very infrequent predators at bird nests in rural New Zealand compared with ship rats (Rattus rattus), harriers and cats (Felis catus). If nest predation and contact attacks by magpies on other species are rare, the cost of magpie aggression for other pasture-feeding species is either disturbance (involving movements of birds for short distances) or exclusion from preferred feeding areas."}, "310": {"paper_id": 310, "title": "Do territorial and non-breeding Australian Magpies Gymnorhina tibicen influence the local movements of rural birds in New Zealand", "full_reference": "Morgan, D., Waas, J.R. & Innes, J., 2006.

The numerous published observations of Australian Magpie attacks are apparently biased heavily towards sensational events that are rare. Accordingly, most rural birds, including all birds that were seen attacked by Magpies in the current study, could compete with Magpies for food. Competition for resources often causes agonistic behaviour between species, with the highest rates of aggression being between species with the most resource overlap. Instead, the species that were counted in the highest numbers close to Magpies were usually the most often attacked, and attacks were more frequent during observations when more birds were counted. Magpies may consider other birds as potential food competitors but are willing to tolerate them in low frequencies within their territory because the energy obtained from the amount of food removed by birds in low density is less than the energy required to chase them away. However, when the numbers of birds counted close to groups increased, the amount of food being removed from the territory may have exceeded the energy required to conduct an attack."}, "311": {"paper_id": 311, "title": "Magpie interactions with other birds in New Zealand: results from a literature review and public survey", "full_reference": "Morgan, D.K., Waas, J., Innes, J.

We predicted that if magpies do have a local-scale impact on the distribution of native birds, visitation rates by native birds during peaks in food availability should be higher at sites where magpies have been removed (quantified by measuring abundance).

We observed the Jay Garrulus glandarius and snakes (species unknown) predating nestlings. The locations of nests in the bamboo thicket differ between the Red-billed Leiothrix and Japanese Bush Warbler. Even in the case where nests of these species were close to each other, direct interaction suggesting in- terspecific territoriality was not observed. It is unlikely that competition for nest-sites occurs between these species. However, indirect interference competition is probable. When we searched for nests of the Red-billed Leiothrix, nests of the Japanese Bush Warbler were also found. A high density of nests may attract various kinds of predators into the breeding areas. In this study, the density of Red-billed Leiothrix nests, which was two to three times higher than that of Japanese Bush Warblers, may have caused an increase in the number of predators and predation on nests.

The tendencies for 14 passerine birds to have positive or negative associations were examined, using 7861 sample points in seven native forests on the islands of Hawaii, Maui, and Kauai To evaluate the association between species and to account for the effect of individual species' habitat preferences, partial correlations were computed for each species-pair in a study area from the simple correlations between the species and 26 habitat variables plus two quadratic terms to represent nonlinearity. Native/exotic pairs had a significantly greater proportion of negative partial correlations (37%) than either native/ native pairs (8%) or exotic/exotic pairs (0%). Analysis of interspecific association among Hawaiian forest birds shows fairly consistent trends across seven forested study areas. By partialing out the effect of habitat, the number of significant negative correlations between the 170 species-pairs (counting each forest occurrence as independent) is significantly reduced from 37 prehabitat to 10 posthabitat correlations (X2 = 20.8, P < 10-5, df= 1)...

The Red-billed Leiothrix/Amakihi pair accounts for the remaining negative correlation. Here the results dramatically show virtually no competitive interaction among native or among exotic species; instead, there is a broad and diffuse \"front\" of competition occurring between the native and exotic avifaunas. The role of competition is further indicated by the greater proportion of negative posthabitat cor- relations among primary potential competitors than among secondary potential competitors.

Leiothrix foraged in a lower vegetational layer with bamboo, intermediate in height between the foraging levels of the Japanese Bush Warbler Cettia diphone and various Parus species. Foraging height, extent of foraging on deciduous trees and foraging technique were major factors best distinguishing Leiothrix from native species. Segregation of foraging niche was distinct and no apparent niche shift, due to invasion of the new species, was detected. Aerial insects tended to be more abundant just above bamboo, mainly about one meter above the canopy, than above bare ground. Thus, jumping, a specific technique used by Leiothrix, is effective for capturing aerial in- sects or agile invertebrates resting on leaves and twigs. Aerial insects were found to be abundant in the foraging space preferred by Leiothrix. Gleaning and hanging, tech- niques mainly used by native species, are suitable for capturing prey of low mobility such as Lepidoptera larvae. Probably due to morphological constraints, Parus spp. and Japanese Bush Warblers seldom foraged by jumping, indicating that they exploit quite different food resources from those utilized by Leiothrix despite their foraging spaces overlapping to some extent. In the deciduous broadleaved forests of Kyushu, an avian guild of foraging aerial insects in intermediate and lower layers of the forests is poor.

The species inhabited urban parks with edible plants and palms (Phoenix spp.).

Individuals showed a consistent preference for nesting in the tallest palms, probably as a way to reduce predation and human disturbance, although other characteristics also could affect the nest location. Implications of these findings for the biology and management of the species are discussed. No ecologically similar birds occur in this area, and thus we assume that Monk Parakeet habitat selection was not constrained by competition with other species.The Monk Parakeet population in Barcelona may be a source population from which birds disperse to surrounding nonurban areas (see Clavell et al. 1991) where the species could become an agricultural pest and, more impor- tantly, have a strong impact on the native biotasee.

If so, they would (1) belong to the western European clade (W1) and (2) be more closely related to the historical, indigenous grey partridges than to farm-bred partridges. These predictions were tested by analysing the variation in both the mitochondrial control region (CR1) and microsatellite markers in museum samples representing the ancestral indigenous Danish grey partridge, contemporary wild grey partridges and farmed grey partridges from the five largest farms in Denmark. The European grey partridge has two evolutionary lines that comprise two genetically different sub-species, Perdix p. perdix (western form) and Perdix p. lucida (eastern form). These lines originate from two different glacial refugees \u2013 the Pyrenees and Iberian Peninsula (western form) and the Balkan/Caucasus region (eastern form). Phylogeography and population structure analyses showed traces of the indigenous Danish grey partridges amongst recent wild partridges in certain areas and significant genetic differences between farmed partridges and historical and recent partridges. The results also showed that the indigenous Danish grey partridges belonged to the western European clade (W1 haplotype). A foreign stocking effect was detected on the remote island of Bornholm, where the current population originated from introduced Danish and Bohemian grey partridges. The loss of haplotype diversity over time in certain geographical areas probably results from serious declines in wild Danish grey partridge numbers in recent decades. This, combined with the observation that hybridization between released stocked and wild partridges can occur, may complicate recovery of partridge populations. The study suggests that the genetic relationship of the recent wild birds is closer to the historical birds than to the birds reared on farms. However, as the most common haplotype W1 is found in all study areas and farms, it is not possible to evaluate whether further introgression between stocked and present, wild partridges has occurred and the consequences of such a process in other areas.

One is the \u201ccompetition hypothesis\u201d, in which an introduced species is so aggressive that it displaces native species from their niches, as for example the Ring-necked Parakeets Psittacula krameri in Europe (Sol et al. 2012; Hern\u00e1ndez-Brito et al. 2014).

Fieldwork was conducted at four sites in western Portugal. Black-headed Weavers could potentially impact native species by displacing them from nesting habitat, or by reducing habitat quality.

So, multiple studiescanhelp to establish general patterns of interactions between an introduced species and a range of native species. For instance, competition for nesting sites from Common Starlings has been well studied in North America and seems not to be a threatening process. Troetschler (1976) found that the Acorn Woodpecker (Melanerpes formicivorus) out-competed Common Starlings for hollows, readily excavated new hollows, or successfully nested or re-nested later in the season and maintained local populations, which was taken to indicate that the Common Starling was not reducing the fecundity of the native species. Vierling (1998) observed 59 pairs of the Lewis\u2019s Woodpecker (Melanerpes lewis) at their nest-hollows and only one hollow was lost to Common Starlings. A series of studies (Ingold 1989, 1994, 1996, 1998) showed that in urban and rural areas, the Common Starling competed successfully with native woodpeckers. In one case, competition with the Red-bellied Woodpecker (Melanerpes carolinus) was intense; 52% of hollows were lost, leading to a significant reduction in fecundity (Ingold 1989). However, for this species and the Red-headed Woodpecker (Melanerpes erythrocephalus) and Northern Flicker (Colaptes auratus), re-nesting and moving into more heavily forested areas where the Common Starling was sparsely distributed were successful strategies to reduce competition with the Common Starling. There was no evidence for reduced fecundity of the Mountain Bluebird (Sialia currucoides) or Tree Swallow (Tachycineta bicolor) in the presence of the Common Starling, although the Tree Swallow did shift its nesting niche (Koch et al. 2012). Notably, analysis of long-term (30+ years) bird distribution datasets for 27 native, hollow-nesting species (including the Red-bellied Woodpecker) showed that only one common species, the Yellow-bellied Sapsucker (Sphyrapicus varius), had a population decline plausibly owing to competition with the Common Starling (Koenig 2003).

The two exotic sturnids were shown to be the dominant users of available nest resources (nest-boxes and natural hollows) in the study sites. The myna was successful in most aggressive encounters with starling and the two native parrots during the period of nest-site selection and occupancy. There was evidence of partitioning of nest resources between species in the different areas and habitats available. The exotic sturnids, particularly the myna, demonstrated the potential to reduce the breeding success of the native parrots studied. The starling was only noticeably successful in agonistic encounters against the eastern rosella, winning 69% of such encounters. The eastern rosella won the majority of its encounters with the red-rumped parrot. Ambrose (1982) found that the red-rumped parrot in and around Melbourne engaged in many agonistic encounters with starlings and usually lost these (lost 80%, 12 of 15 encounters). Such outcomes may be of importance in determining the use of smaller hollows, not accessible to myna and crimson rosella. It is known (Moeed & Dawson, 1979) that entrance diameters < 45 mm exclude myna but allow access to starling. Overall, the study has generated strong circumstantial evidence of the potenial of the introduced sturnids, particularly the common myna, adversely to affect the breeding success of crimson and eastern rosellas in savannah and woodland areas, particularly those close to urban centres. Both introduced sturnids were major users of natural hollows, with the starling probably making greater use of hollows of smaller entrance diameter. In this respect, starlings may have an important influence on the breeding success of the red-rumped parrot."}, "494": {"paper_id": 494, "title": "Competition between European Starlings and Native Woodpeckers for Nest Cavities in Saguaros", "full_reference": "Kerpez, T.

Many birds species consume L. maackii fruits during the winter in southwest Ohio, but only five species of birds disperse its seeds. Seed dispersal by birds, combined with the ability to germinate without gut passage, makes control of this species difficult. Established populations will likely be able to recruit more shrubs beneath their canopies, while seeds dispersed by birds can germinate in new sites.

Introduced in 1929, white-eye successfully invaded old- growth forest and coexisted with eight native species , overlapping multiple foraging substrates with each but evidencing no agonistic interactions. The endangered Hawaii akepa (Loxops coccineus coccineus) was viable during 1987\u20131999 but became nonviable during 2000\u20132006 in association with an abrupt increase in white-eyes. We show that after 2000, juveniles of every native bird species measured had lower mass and shorter bills and tarsi. For most species, lower mass led to decreased juvenile survival, and shorter bills to decreased survival of second-year and older adults. Lower survival of smaller birds represents normalizing selection that is restoring previous size means to future generations. Birds at a nearby site with fewer white-eyes had normal size. We measured bill length, tarsus length, and mass of seven species of native Hawaiian birds and introduced Japanese white-eyes (Zosterops japonicus) during 1987\u20132006 in Hakalau Forest National Wildlife Refuge on the Island of Hawaii. Morphological changes in native juveniles were precisely associated with the increase in white-eyes beginning in 2000. White-eye had less stunting of bills and did not suffer the survival consequences of native species. Exploitative competition for food between native birds and an introduced species requires intensive management to prevent further declines. The Hawaii akepa, Hawaii amakihi (Hemignathus virens virens), and Hawaii elepaio, native species with bill sizes similar to the white-eye, had both lower apparent juvenile and lower second-year survival. The iiwi (Vestiaria coccinea), which shares the most common foraging substrate with the white-eye, had lower apparent second-year survival. The Hawaii creeper (Oreomystis mana), which forages for arthropods on bark rather than gleaning arthropods on foliage, had slightly lower apparent juvenile survival. The apapane (Himatione sanguinea) declined in density throughout the middle-elevation stratum of the refuge, an area much larger than our study sites, but change in second-year survival was difficult to estimate.

The data suggested that the population density of A. familiare had not been affected by the spreading Z. japonicus . The body weight of fledgling A. familiare was not affected significantly by the presence of Z. japonicus . Food items taken by A. familiare were similar to those of Z. japonicus . Where the species did not coexist, A. familiare foraged at all heights of the forest, but in the area of overlap, this species reduced its use of higher parts of the forest canopy where Z. japonicus foraged frequently.

Of the 2365 wild birds analyzed for blood parasites during this study, 7.8% were infected with Plasmodium (all of the native species and 0.9% of the Japanese White-eye population were infected). Cultures of malarial organisms were established from wild-caught, moribund, introduced and endemic Hawaiian forest birds. The cultures were maintained through subinoculations of infected blood into canaries, a standard method employed in Plasmodium research. After capture, all experimental birds were allowed a closely monitored acclimation period of no less than 2 mo, during which time they were fed food ad libitum. During this acclimation period body masses were taken every 2nd day, and blood smears taken on a regular weekly basis and searched for the presence of haematozoan infections. Following the parasite-clearing process, five captive Apapane, Iiwi, Red-billed Leiothrix, Japanese White-eye, Laysan Finches, and Mauna Loa Common Amakihi, and six Mauna Kea Common Amakihi, were inoculated intramuscularly with 0.1 mL of first-passage infected canary blood. Each species group was challenged within a 2-d period with blood of similar parasitemia levels from the same canary host; 16 schizonts were subinoculated into each bird. Each of the experimental birds that succumbed was found upon necropsy to have an extremely high level of malarial parasites. Although survival differed among the challenged native host species, parasitemia levels throughout the patent period were similar.The results of this study clearly demonstrate that malaria is present in native bird populations and can readily kill these birds. Avian malaria, although probably introduced during recent times, has been only one of many reasons for the decline of this unique avifauna.

To understand the role of introduced species in current seed-dispersal systems, we conducted fecal analyses of the most common resident land birds on the Bonin Islands, Japan, and estimated their relative importance as seed-dispersal agents. Two native birds, the brown-eared bulbul and the Bonin Islands white-eye, and the introduced Japanese white-eye were the primary seed dispersers in secondary forest sites. Because the seed species composition in the feces of native and introduced white-eyes was similar, the latter may be replacing the former as a seed-dispersal agent. Introduced plants did not decrease the number of seed- dispersal opportunities for native species through com- petition for seed dispersers. Because some bird species have already become extinct on the Bonin Islands, their ecological functions may also have been permanently lost; however, the introduced white-eye may be com- pensating for this loss of function. In addition, new mutualistic relationships involving native and intro- duced birds and plants have already been established. In order to control introduced species while having the least impact on the native biota, interspecific interactions must be thoroughly understood before initiating control efforts. Approximately 100 years have passed since the introduction of the Japanese white-eye (Momiyama 1930), and a new mutualistic relationship between the introduced bird species and the native ecosystem has already established. Although there have been harmful effects on the native ecosystem, the introduced white-eye has likely become an essential component of the current ecosystem after long-term naturalization. The disap- pearance of the introduced white-eye may lead to further declines in native plants through the lack of a seed-dispersal agent."}}}, "val": {"Callipepla californica": {"195": {"paper_id": 195, "title": "The California Quail in Hawaii", "full_reference": "Schwartz, C.

Two frugivores increased consumption of M. calvescens fruit at highly invaded sites and decreased consumption of other dietary items. The endemic fruit dove, Ptilinopus purpuratus, consumed more native fruit than either of the two introduced frugivores (the red-vented bulbul, Pycnonotus cafer, and the silvereye, Zosterops lateralis), and introduced frugivores showed a low potential to act as dispersers of native plants.

Biological invasion threatens the sandy-savanna Mussununga ecosystem in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. Biological Invasions, 21(6), pp.2045-2057.", "label": ["MO - Moderate"], "evidence": "With respect to the hypotheses described at the beginning of this study, we found that (1) Acacia has a negative effect on woody species composition, causing death of plants, and on increment in total height and total basal area of the invaded Mussununga; (2) disturbance and land-use change affect diversity and structure of the vegetation; and (3) the ground layer community was not affected by Acacia, while biological invasion seems to be the main driver in the woody layer. [...] The negative relation of A. mangium and A. auriculiformis on the woody layer community in Mussununga is in agreement with other studies that evaluated different species of acacias (e.g., Costello et al. 2000; Marchante et al. 2003; Rascher et al. 2011) and corroborates that Acacia dominance is a key factor in the destruction of the Mussununga ecosystem (Meira-Neto et al. 2017). The effect of Acacia invasion on the woody community suggests a replacement of species, caused mainly by Acacia and the death of native woody plants (see Fig. 1). That is a concern since the plant species in Mussununga are adapted to very specific environmental conditions with a combination of flooding and drought and nutrient-poor sandy soil (Meira-Neto et al. 2005; Saporetti-Junior et al. 2012; Gastauer et al. 2017). However, the positive relationship of the basal area of Acacia with abundance and basal area of native woody species challenges our previous expectations. Although the process of (re-)cover after disturbance is a parsimonious interpretation (see below \u2018\u2018Threats to the Mussununga ecosystem\u2019\u2019; Fig. 4), Acacia acts as nurse plant in the early invasion stage in the Mussununga ecosystem, as supported by the higher native species richness in Acacia-focused plots than noninvaded ones (Meira-Neto et al. 2017). When at low density, Acacia possibly can benefit native species by ameliorating the stressed conditions in Mussununga, providing shade and increasing soil nitrogen and carbon contents (Marchante et al. 2009; Hellmann et al. 2011; Meira-Neto et al. 2017), thereby, facilitating the establishment of plants not adapted to stress conditions. For instance, Yang et al. (2009) found better physiological status and lower stress in shaded plants under A. mangium and A. auriculiformis canopies in China. We hypothesize that the positive effect of nitrogen addition and shading in the Mussununga should only occur up to a threshold of Acacia abundance. After becoming dominant, Acacia would outcompete the light-demanding species (Meira-Neto et al. 2017) and possibly favor their own seedlings (Rascher et al. 2011). This point of view is corroborated here by the positive relationship of the basal area of Acacia on the woody layer community and, contrarily, the statistical effect of the abundance of Acacia on the proportion of dead plants (Fig. 2d, e, f) and by the fact that the negative effects of invasion of Acacia species frequently take decades to appear (Koutika and Richardson 2019). The increase of biomass promoted by Acacia measured by total basal area and the total geometric mean of height (that is, including Acacia in the measurement) indicates a change in the vegetation structure of the Mussununga. Therefore, the gradient of vegetation types from grassland to woodland, limited by flooding, nutrient content in soil, and fire (Saporetti-Junior et al. 2012; Gastauer et al. 2017), is unbalanced by Acacia occurrence. Despite the negative effect on the native woody community, following Acacia invasion, the sandy-savanna Mussununga tends to become taller and more closed with consequent reduction of light availability and increase of nitrogen content. This trend is clearly related to the capacity of the Acacia species studied here to grow faster and taller than native plants from Mussununga, and even in the early stages of invasion this can already be detected using aerial images (Lehmann et al. 2017). Under this new environmental condition, the typical light-demanding species of Mussununga could be replaced by shade-tolerant ones or, in worse scenarios, by Acacia itself becoming a monodominant forest."}, "3": {"paper_id": 3, "title": "Plant species diversity in tropical planted forests and implication for restoration of forest ecosystems in Sakaerat, Northeastern Thailand", "full_reference": "KAMO, K., VACHARANGKURA, T., TIYANON, S., VIRIYABUNCHA, C., NIMPILA, S. and DOANGSRISEN, B., 2002.

Thus, considering that flocks are more detrimental to SAV as compared to paired mute swans, we recommend that initial emphasis primarily be placed on controlling mute swans in flocks and secondarily on pairs."}}, "Dicrurus macrocercus": {"249": {"paper_id": 249, "title": "What caused the population decline of the Bridled White-eye on Rota, Mariana Island", "full_reference": "Fancy, S.

However, it is very unlikely that the Black Drongo, which is primarily insectivorous (Thyagaraju 1934, Ali and Futehally 1970, Drahos 1977, Maben 1982) could have caused an island-wide range contraction and major population decline of the Bridled White-eye. On Guam, Drahos (1977) found only trace samples of bird bones in 82 drongo stomachs, and Maben (1982) found bird bones in only one of 113 drongo stomachs. Maben (1982: 73) wrote that \u201cdespite this well-documented ability to eat small birds, I did not observe drongos regularly attempting to capture and eat small birds even when seemingly available,\u201d and she concluded that predatory interactions between drongos and other birds were not a significant factor in the decline of Guam\u2019s forest bird populations. The drongo hypothesis does not explain why white-eyes are absent from several blocks of seemingly pristine limestone forest at higher el-evations where drongos do not occur, nor why populations of Micronesian Honeyeaters (Myzomela ruhrutru) and Rufous Fantails have not experienced similar population declines."}}, "Kittacincla malabarica": {"328": {"paper_id": 328, "title": "The distribution and abundance of the alien invasive White-rumped Shama (Copsychus malabaricus) in Taiwan", "full_reference": "Fan MW, Lin Fang RSW, Lin YH (2009) The distribution and abundance of the alien invasive White-rumped Shama (Copsychus malabaricus) in Taiwan. 54(3): 248-254.", "label": ["DD - Data deficient "], "evidence": "White-rumped Shama, however, has invaded indigenous forests.

There were significant differences in prevalence rates (P = 0.002) among the species of introduced birds (Table 1). The highest rates of malaria (>20%) were found in White-rumped Shama (Copsychus malabaricus). The association of the current decline in native bird populations with the continued introduction of alien species is attributable to at least two hypotheses: (1) direct competition between natives and aliens for food, nesting, or other resources (Moulton and Pimm 1983); and (2) greater susceptibility (mor- bidity, mortality) of natives to infectious diseases and novel strains of pathogens that arrive with each introduction The full impact of malaria on bird populations can only be evaluated with an efficient diagnostic that can detect very low levels of the parasite. Our suggestion that the disease hypothesis more fully accounts for the continued decline of native birds, rather than the effects of competition between introduced and native species, is based on our findings that malarial infections have been systematically underreported in all species tested prior to PCR-based assays."}}, "Pelophylax lessonae": {"424": {"paper_id": 424, "title": "New contact zone and assemblages among water frogs of Southern France", "full_reference": "Pagano A, Lod\u00e9 T, Crochet PA (2001) New contact zone and assemblages among water frogs of Southern France.

The number of potential nesting sites available in an area and proximity to fresh water were important determinants of occupancy of nest sites by Rosellas. In urban areas where mature, cavity-bearing trees were rare, Rosellas were observed using alternative nesting sites in tree ferns. This apparent flexibility in nesting behaviour may have contributed to the success and spread of Eastern Rosellas within New Zealand. Studies of cavity-nesting bird communities elsewhere support the suggestion that introduced species can both successfully compete for the use of nesting sites, and induce further partitioning of cavity resources. It is possible that exotic cavity-nesting birds may be having a similar effect on native New Zealand species, or may do so in the future as populations expand and overlap. Further investigation is needed to understand the role of introduced species and competition on the availability of cavity nest-site resources within New Zealand forests."}}, "Rhinella jimi": {"465": {"paper_id": 465, "title": "Blind toads in paradise: the cascading effect of vision loss on a tropical archipelago", "full_reference": "Tolledo J, Toledo LF (2015) Blind toads in paradise: the cascading effect of vision loss on a tropical archipelago.
