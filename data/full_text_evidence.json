    "So why did prions persist while Blue Petrels perished?",

    "Acacia invasion The negative relation of A. mangium and A. auriculiformis on the woody layer community in Mussununga is in agreement with other studies that evaluated different species of acacias (e.g., Costello et al. 2000;Marchante et al. 2003;Rascher et al. 2011) and corroborates that Acacia dominance is a key factor in the destruction of the Mussununga ecosystem (Meira-Neto et al. 2017).",
    "The effect of Acacia invasion on the woody community suggests a replacement of species, caused mainly by Acacia and the death of native woody plants (see Fig. ).",

    "However, the positive relationship of the basal area of Acacia with abundance and basal area of native woody species challenges our previous expectations.",
    "Although the process of (re-)cover after disturbance is a parsimonious interpretation (see below ''Threats to the Mussununga ecosystem''; Fig. ), Acacia acts as nurse plant in the early invasion stage in the Mussununga ecosystem, as supported by the higher native species richness in Acacia-focused plots than noninvaded ones (Meira-Neto et al. 2017).",
    "When at low density, Acacia possibly can benefit native species by ameliorating the stressed conditions in Mussununga, providing shade and increasing soil nitrogen and carbon contents (Marchante et al. 2009;Hellmann et al. 2011;Meira-Neto et al. 2017), thereby, facilitating the establishment of plants not adapted to stress conditions.",
    "For instance, Yang et al. (2009) found better physiological status and lower stress in shaded plants under A. mangium and A. auriculiformis canopies in China.",
    "We hypothesize that the positive effect of nitrogen addition and shading in the Mussununga should only occur up to a threshold of Acacia abundance.",
    "After becoming dominant, Acacia would outcompete the light-demanding species (Meira-Neto et al. 2017) and possibly favor their own seedlings (Rascher et al. 2011).",
    "This point of view is corroborated here by the positive relationship of the basal area of Acacia on the woody layer community and, contrarily, the statistical effect of the abundance of Acacia on the proportion of dead plants (Fig. 2d,e,f) and by the fact that the negative effects of invasion of Acacia species frequently take decades to appear (Koutika and Richardson 2019).",
    "The increase of biomass promoted by Acacia measured by total basal area and the total geometric mean of height (that is, including Acacia in the measurement) indicates a change in the vegetation structure of the Mussununga.",
    "Therefore, the gradient of vegetation types from grassland to woodland, limited by flooding, nutrient content in soil, and fire (Saporetti-Junior et al. 2012;Gastauer et al. 2017), is unbalanced by Acacia occurrence.",
    "Despite the negative effect on the native woody community, following Acacia invasion, the sandy-savanna Mussununga tends to become taller and more closed with consequent reduction of light availability and increase of nitrogen content.",
    "This trend is clearly related to the capacity of the Acacia species studied here to grow faster and taller than native plants from Mussununga, and even in the early stages of invasion this can already be detected using aerial images (Lehmann et al. 2017).",

    "The association of the current decline in native bird populations with the continued introduction of alien species is attributable to at least two hypotheses: (1) direct competition between natives and aliens for food, nesting, or other resources (Moulton and Pimm 1983); and (2) greater susceptibility (morbidity, mortality) of natives to infectious diseases and novel strains of pathogens that arrive with each introduction (Warner 1968, van Riper et al. 1986, Atkinson et al. 1995, Cann et al. 1996).",
